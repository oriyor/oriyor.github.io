Computer Science PhD candidate (2nd year) at Tel-Aviv University advised by Prof. Jonathan Berant and NLP research lead at Ask-AI. 

My main area of research is Natural Language Understanding. 
I am mostly excited about building and analyzing systems that reason to perform tasks that are helpful and complex, such as multi-hop question answering or multi-modal reasoning. My most recent work focuses on improving performance, efficiency, and robustness of current systems for tool-augmented and retrieval-augmented large language models.

In my industry position, I am a founding team member and research lead at Ask-AI, where we work on developing a generative AI sidekick that reasons over enterprise data. I was also lucky enough to intern at Microsoft and AI2 during my studies.
